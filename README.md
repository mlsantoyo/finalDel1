### Overview
The Florida State Horseshoe Pitchers Association (FSHPA) teaches, fosters, develops, and promotes the sport of horseshoe pitching within the State of Florida. Also, it authorizes, provides guidelines, and schedules all NHPA/FSHPA Inc. sanctioned tournaments, both as a recreational pastime and a competitive sport.

The association has been using computer programs to keep track of membership and statistics and it has created websites for the various FL clubs but the tournament entry process is still manual.  The manual process is prone to errors and leads to repetivite work, most notably for team tournaments or multiple state tournaments. 

A web application where pitchers could enter a tournament and pay in advance would: 
  *allow pitchers to confirm that they are entered to the tournament
  *save time for the tournament director
  *reduce repetition for the tournament director

### Research
FSHPA does not have a tournament entry app at the club or state level. This will be the first. 

There are a few at the local club level in other states that will be used as reference for best practices. 


### User Story
As a pitcher, I want to sign up online for a tournament so that I have immediate confirmation of my entry. 

As a pitcher, I want to pay the entry fee in advance so that I can reserve my spot. 

As a tournament director, I want to view the list of entrants so that I can plan the tournament. 

As a tournament director, I want to collect entry fees in advance so that I reduce the number of participant cancelations.

As a tournament director, I want to have one repository of entrants so that I can avoid multiple changes. 

As a facilities director, I want to view the number of entrants so that I can prepare the courts.
